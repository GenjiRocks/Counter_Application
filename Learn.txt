Redux:
1, Its a JS library for state management
    Components:
    1, store - State is created inside the store rather than creating in the parent (store.js file)
       a,State can be globally accessible
       b, configureStore() :  function to create store
    2, action : it holds the logic to update the state. (state needs to call the action for any changes and cannot change directly)
        a, dispatch: calling the action file
        b, hook is used called useDispatch()
        c, payload : output of action
        d, createAction() - funciton to create action
    3, reducer : this can only update store
        a, createReducer : function to create reducer

    To Access state from Store -> Component = useSelector()

2, Redux Toolkit:
 1, Slice : it has both action and reducer files in single file
 2, in toolkit action and reducer are not consirered as seperate files
 3, slice returns both action(logic to update state) and reducer (ability to update the state)
